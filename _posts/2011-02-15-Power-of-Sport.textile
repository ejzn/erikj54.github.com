title: The Power of Sport
---
<p>
I have trained at a decently high level in several sports. While I have not yet been able to compete at the Olympic level, sport is my life. I live for the morning when I can run, bike, swim or get my heart rate going. I live for the competition that puts my problems at ease and allows me to focus and enter "The Zone". The Olympics have come under scrutiny in the past couple years for being too commercial or only a competition of the elite. I think we need to revists these issues and really look at what the Olympics is all about.

The Olympics is about uniting. It's not about sponsorship or corporations. These things are inherent in any event on the scale of the Olympics. Sport has a funny way of uniting countries and peoples from all different backgrounds and all different religions. In South Africa, Nelson Mandella was able to use sport to effectively unite the people under the Springboks. In New Orleans a broken and unhappy people found happiness in the New Orlean Saints "Who Dat?". The Olympics are not perfect, but the idea is: Unite us under sport.

<p> There is something magical that happens when you push your mind and your body in competition. You discover who you are.</p>
