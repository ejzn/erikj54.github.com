title: Switching from Wordpress to Jekyll
---

This post is about my migration from Wordpress and my old blogging system to Jekyll. If you want technical details check out the following: <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/blog-migrations">link</a>.

*Why did I switch*

Why did I switch? I swtiched because my blog had no need for a database. It is in effect a bunch of text and very little photos. Worpress is a great peice of software and 
the plugins can really make someone happy with the product. I have no need for all the complexity. I simply wanted somewhere to write my ideas down with some control.

*I got my blog back*

As a person who understand a fair bit more then the average blogger. I wanted the control back. I got my blog back. I was able to get control of the site content again. I'm now using git for all the content and web pages which is a super bonus. I can run and test on my local
machine using the built in Jekyll server and push to the master branch when I want to deploy live. It's great!
