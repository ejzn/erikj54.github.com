title: Pitch-it Reflections

Well today was the Pitch-it competetion at UVIC. 120 seconds to explain your idea and concept to the judges for a chance at 300$. There were lots of great ideas and I'm not totally ashamed to say I was not a finalist. The feedback was good from the panel but they seemed unconvinced over the revenue potential. So since I didn't have time to show them during the presentation I will rant here:

First, a small software solution that manages volunteers has a large market potential. There are thousands of small volunteer driven events all across North America. I'm not saying were going to be be billionaires but it is not a stretch to imagine 100 subscriptions a month to our service. 100 subscriptions would translate into approx 20,000 dollars in revenue a month. 

I pick this number since I don't need to sell 200 dollars to the volunteer organization. I need to sell it to the coordinator. I'm sure I'll find out what the market is willing to pay but in the end my "sales force" will be the coordinators who will love the system.

I'm hoping in the plan-it I can stress that following two main points:

First, move the bottle neck of communication from the coordinator onto the users, by allowing user to user contact.

Second allow users to pick your shifts and they are happy and not stuck with shifts there not interested in.
