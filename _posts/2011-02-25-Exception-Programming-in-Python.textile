title: Exception Programming in Python
---
<p>
I thought I better throw up some of my ideas before I forget to do this. Have you ever thought about using exceptions in your normal program flow? Well apparently it's not the WORST thing ever. As far as we can tell the languages that try and make us follow all there big time rules end up with larger problems in the end: Massive memory footprints, so many modules it's reading an essay to find where some code is located, and the list goes on and on. So what about a simple exception? Consider this:
<br />
You would like to insert a value into a list, or some other structure and if it's already there, well you don't want a duplicate, but if it's not, you want it in there right?

In Python it's really quite simple:

<p>This allows is to handle the error if the key does not exist, then we just put it in. Simple right? I thought so too.
