<p>We are at an impasse. To be effective at marketing, politics, or just plain influence on people we must find a way to matter. How can we matter when our days are filled with junk everywhere? It seems as though everyone on Twitter is an expert at helping entrepreneurs. Everyone is an expert at getting things done, or shipping an awesome product. Then why are they pumping my Inbox or twitter feed full of crap?</p>
<p>We know the story, your building the next twitter/ MySpace for single adult that live at home and make no money. Got it, check. Why don&#8217;t we stop building useless crap and invest our time in something that matters? I&#8217;ve fallen victim to this as well. We try anything to succeed. We try and copy what was, what is, in an attempt to get our small piece of the pie. Why does all this matter? The world is now full of shit. There are too many social networks, too many advertisement on websites, too many charities and too many causes.</p>
<p>The facts are no one gives a shit. They don&#8217;t want to interrupt there day to listen to what you have to say. So why are you wasting your time pumping there lives full of crap. I say we need to start over about what we really care about. Let people who want on to your bandwagon to join in. If they don&#8217;t want in fuck em.</p>
<p>If there are a million charities which one are you most likely to donate too? How about what advertisements you&#8217;ll listen too? Probably something your interested in. Not some random stuff. There is just too much out there, you&#8217;ve got your clutter filter on.</p>
<p>Do you think Seth Godin interrupts peoples day to tell them shit? Does he try and sell you crap you don&#8217;t want? People come to him. Granted he did start with a little tech start-up called Squidoo. The point is, people want to make lenses on Squidoo, just like people are enjoying Facebook for the time being. But as a Facebook user you can&#8217;t connect with everyone. Just as users on twitter with a zillion friends can&#8217;t read all there shit. The world is too cluttered.</p>
<p>So pick something you care about and focus on that. The people that want in will join you and as Seth says: lead that tribe. It could be surfing, swimming, but my god it sure as hell can&#8217;t be social networking. Get that shit out of here.</p>
