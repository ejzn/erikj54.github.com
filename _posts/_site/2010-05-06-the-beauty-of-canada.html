<p>The beauty of Canada is in the people and the landscapes. I&#8217;m not just talking about the sheer size which is cool but the immense diversity across the nation. There are several different regions wether Manitoba&#8217;s wheat fields, Nova Scotia&#8217;s rocky coastline, Alberta and BC Rockies or Norther Ontario&#8217;s wilderness. Then of curse the people hippie BC&#8217;ers, French from Quebec or the Newfie fisherman.</p>
<p>It makes you wonder what brought us together? Who and Why? Well I&#8217;m sure people all have their opinions about the British and our loyalty to the throne in the past. Regarless standing on the citadel hill in Halifax I&#8217;m glad it is here for me to enjoy and a country I can really be proud of.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure why I used to be loyal or excited about being Canadien apart from the obvious reasons (Hockey etc) but I do know nw after meetin countless nice people why I love this Country. In Halifax some locals bought us a round of Keiths and made us feel very welcome. In Northern Ontario in Cochrane a young wItress got us a place to stay at her ex Father in law&#8217;s field. In Montreal staying with friends or having or broken window covered and properly cleanuped for free by a bunch of nice guys.</p>
<p>I can now say that I love this country for a reason. I&#8217;m proud to be from here and I feel lucky to have this large country accesible to me. I&#8217;m sure there are countless other countries that have similar things to Canada with plenty of nice people I think this is why Im so excited to travel.</p>
<p>For now I will bask in the beauty and niceness that is Canada.</p>
<p>Go Nucks.</p>
