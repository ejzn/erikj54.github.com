<p>I recently purchased a used Nexus One. While I love the idea of a smartphone, I believe I understand the impacts associated with such a device. Cell phones have become a prime example of our impatience as people of this planet. The tech industry is exploding and the landscape is changing. People are losing land lines in favour of cell phones. Cell phones are being replaced nearly every two years. For me I pushed my previous phone to four years. I bought a used phone for a couple reasons:</p>
<p>First and foremost I wanted to purchase something that need not be replaced. The resources have already been mined. Second, I wanted to contemplate the decision and not fall victim to the trap laid by companies that we must have only the best. For me the Nexus One is the perfect solution. It&#8217;s a great phone that runs a great OS, with lots of tools for my needs.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how we can solve such a situation where the tech industry and the environment go hand in hand. We should not have to stiffle innovation to protect the land. They should be one of the same.<p></p>
