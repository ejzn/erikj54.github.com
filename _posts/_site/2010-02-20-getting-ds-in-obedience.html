<p>Here is something new I&#8217;m going to try: Get an assignment in school and not do it. I&#8217;m going to do something better, something more creative and inventive. Why not? Should I get a D it just may be the best D ever. It will be a D in obedience and an A in being unique, different and creative. Are you being creative? Are you being trained to respond to the rules? Are you getting A&#8217;s at doing what your told? Is this what you dreamed of as a kid? Doing what your told? Being the best at following the rules? I hope not. Think about it, disobey.</p>
