<p>I just came across this today through the Boris&#8230;<a href="http://www.phonegap.com/">Phone Gap</a>. It seems like a really cool project. As the name suggest it&#8217;s bridging the gap between phones. I would love to try it out. Maybe once I get some time&#8230;and once I get a smartphone ;). Phone Gap is essentially a framework that let&#8217;s you write <span class="caps">HTML</span> and JavaScript for the IPhone. Blackberry etc. The code runs cross platform. Not to mention you can port existing apps to mobile phones since you already have the code :). Anywho check <a href="http://www.phonegap.com/">this</a> out it&#8217;s really neat.</p>
<p>This raises an interesting question that I&#8217;ll ponder. With Google&#8217;s new OS being basically a web browser, what does this bode for the future of JavaScript and HTML5? Is the future in <span class="caps">HTML</span> 5? It seems that way. With Phone Gap you can now write <span class="caps">HTML</span> and JavaScript without having to write Objective-C. That&#8217;s neat.</p>
<p>It seems more and more there are conversion technologies, Python &#8594; JavaScript / <span class="caps">HTML</span>,  JavaScript / <span class="caps">HTML</span> &#8594; Objective C it&#8217;s a neat trend.</p>
