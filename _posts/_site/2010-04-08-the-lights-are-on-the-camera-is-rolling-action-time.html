<p>Here goes&#8230;..today was the last day&#8230;.and now action:</p>
<p>&#8220;The main idea is to be conscious of what we do &#8230; While I felt this way for some time, it was only recently that I was  able to get past my own habits and such and to make a move, to do  something, which as far as I understand, is what it&#8217;s all  about. Action.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adapted quote from Matisyahu&#8230;.it just seems relevant event taken a bit out of context. We must start to take action. Action in our future, our life, our habits. Consciousness is not a gifts but a curse, a curse that can be controlled only by action. Once conscious we are required to do &#8220;the only thing worth doing&#8221;&#8230;..the only thing worth doing indeed.</p>
