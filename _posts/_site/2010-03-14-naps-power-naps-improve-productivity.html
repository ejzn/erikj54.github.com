<p>Do you nap? I don&#8217;t well, I do when I&#8217;m not at school or working and I can afford to have a quick lie down. It&#8217;s interesting I never thought about the in-depth nature of naps until I stumbled upon this <a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/naps/"/> post</a>. It&#8217;s really great. I think an afternoon recharge is just what people need. So I would almost advocate a half hour lay down, stress free, with a book or an <span class="caps">IPOD</span> instead of our common practice of coffee. Coffee is a crutch. I don&#8217;t drink coffee to stay awake and I think it&#8217;s ludicrous to think that business and start-ups are founded around coffee.</p>
<p>Sleep is awesome. Don&#8217;t you feel that sluggishness after lunch that need take a break and catch a quick <span class="caps">ZZZ</span>? Now I&#8217;m not advocating that we start cots as they have at Microsoft. Heaven forbid that could be taken advantage of. But what about a nice peaceful spot? Maybe on a yoga mat? Just a thought.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d bet productivity would increase, I&#8217;m not even implying in the traditional sense. Imagine if you don&#8217;t feel zapped after work? Would you do more? Maybe prepare some better meals, have better morale? Make your lunch ahead of time for the next day? Go to bed earlier since everything you wanted to get done got done? Procrastinate less? I know this is speculation, but if you get balls rolling down hill they&#8217;ll keep each other going if one of the group hits a bump.</p>
