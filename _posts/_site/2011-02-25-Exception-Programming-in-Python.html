<p>I thought I better throw up some of my ideas before I forget to do this. Have you ever thought about using exceptions in your normal program flow? Well apparently it&#8217;s not the <span class="caps">WORST</span> thing ever. As far as we can tell the languages that try and make us follow all there big time rules end up with larger problems in the end: Massive memory footprints, so many modules it&#8217;s reading an essay to find where some code is located, and the list goes on and on. So what about a simple exception? Consider this:<br />
<br />
You would like to insert a value into a list, or some other structure and if it&#8217;s already there, well you don&#8217;t want a duplicate, but if it&#8217;s not, you want it in there right?</p>
</p>

<p>In Python it&#8217;s really quite simple:<br />

<p>This allows is to handle the error if the key does not exist, then we just put it in. Simple right? I thought so too.</p>
