<p>This post is about my migration from Wordpress and my old blogging system to Jekyll. Itt will be a short post. If you want technical details check out the following: <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/blog-migrations">link</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why did I switch</strong></p>
<p>Why did I switch? I swtiched because my blog had no need for a database. It is in effect a bunch of text and very little photos. Worpress is a great peice of software and <br />
the plugins can really make someone happy with the product. I have no need for all the complexity. I simply wanted somewhere to write my ideas down with some control.</p>
<p><strong>I got my blog back</strong><br />
As a person who understand a fair bit more then the average blogger. I wanted the control back.I got my blog back. I was able to get control of the site content again. I&#8217;m now using git for all the content and web pages which is a super bonus. I can run and test on my local<br />
machine using the built in Jekyll server and push to the master branch when I want to deploy live. It&#8217;s great!</p>
