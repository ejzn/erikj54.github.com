<p>Is it possible to live in two worlds? Let me start by defining what I mean by two worlds. Academia is a world seperate in that it has it&#8217;s own process, it&#8217;s own standards, sets of rules governing behaviour, rewards for specific accomplishments and so forth. This is very much in agreement with our greater &#8220;world&#8221;. Society as a whole has process&#8217;, standards, social contracts, reawrds for specific beahviour etc.</p>

<p>So my question becomes, are there two distinct world, to which membership is hard and stressful and actually decreases your success in one world vs another. Logically this would seem that yes, it is the case. I beleive there are worlds that are not distinct, but there are some, that are in fact distinct.<br />

This subject is current crossing my mind because I am a Masters student at the University of Victoria. In the past I have rowed for the university in the sporting &#8220;world&#8221;. I did well at school, but I never quite excelled to the best of my abilities, this was because I could not always give things the attention they deserved. Currently I am not rowing, and this is a choice I am conscious of the worlds I am a part of. At this stage in my life I am not a Road Schlar. I am not able to be a part of the Academia world and the Sporting world. Perhaps in the future I will again be able to, but for now I wish to excel at one world. Then I will try two.</p>
