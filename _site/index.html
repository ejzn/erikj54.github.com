		<h2><a href="/2011/01/23/Getting-Connected.html">Getting Connected</a></h2>
		<p>
<p>I recently purchased a used Nexus One. While I love the idea of a smartphone, I believe I understand the impacts associated with such a device. Cell phones have become a prime example of our impatience as people of this planet. The tech industry is exploding and the landscape is changing. People are losing land lines in favour of cell phones. Cell phones are being replaced nearly every two years. For me I pushed my previous phone to four years. I bought a used phone for a couple reasons:</p>
<p>First and foremost I wanted to purchase something that need not be replaced. The resources have already been mined. Second, I wanted to contemplate the decision and not fall victim to the trap laid by companies that we must have only the best. For me the Nexus One is the perfect solution. It&#8217;s a great phone that runs a great OS, with lots of tools for my needs.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how we can solve such a situation where the tech industry and the environment go hand in hand. We should not have to stiffle innovation to protect the land. They should be one of the same.<p></p>

		<p>I had to add this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">link<a/> to my blog because it pretty much sums up how I feel. While things have been awesome in my life, it&#8217;s hard not to wonder whether it&#8217;s just the luck that I was born a white male in Western Canada? Just some thoughts.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2010/12/21/Switching-to-Jekyll.html">Switching from Wordpress to Jekyll</a></h2>
		<p>This post is about my migration from Wordpress and my old blogging system to Jekyll. If you want technical details check out the following: <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/blog-migrations">link</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why did I switch</strong></p>
<p>Why did I switch? I swtiched because my blog had no need for a database. It is in effect a bunch of text and very little photos. Worpress is a great peice of software and <br />
the plugins can really make someone happy with the product. I have no need for all the complexity. I simply wanted somewhere to write my ideas down with some control.</p>
<p><strong>I got my blog back</strong></p>
<p>As a person who understand a fair bit more then the average blogger. I wanted the control back. I got my blog back. I was able to get control of the site content again. I&#8217;m now using git for all the content and web pages which is a super bonus. I can run and test on my local<br />
machine using the built in Jekyll server and push to the master branch when I want to deploy live. It&#8217;s great!</p>

		<h2><a href="/2010/08/11/rentingborrowing-vs-buying.html">Renting/Borrowing vs Buying</a></h2>
		<p>This post is inspired by a <a href="http://georgesaines.com/2010/08/10/be-happier-rent-everything/">posting</a> on Hacker news. Where George examines renting vs buying.</p>
<p>This subject is interesting to me. Why do we all need to own everything? Is it more environmentally friendly for us to all have our own chainsaw at home? Or would it be more beneficial for a couple people we know to own one? It would seem that the latter would be a more efficient use of the earth&#8217;s resources.<br />
So why is this not the case? My personal opinion on this is the following:</p>
<p><strong>We are conditioned by companies to want our own everything</strong></p>
<p>Our own house, car, Ipod, everything. No of course I&#8217;m not saying we need to share everything. Give it some thought though. Imagine yourself walking next store and borrowing the lawnmower from your neighbor. Imagine if he was the only one on the road who had one? Wow, wow, wow, I know what your thinking. Geez, Erik that sounds like a community. But you know a community is pretty much socialism, which is pretty much communism and that is just evil. Or is it? Should we start being less internal in our homes and our lives?</p>
<p>I believe we need to start shifting our feelings, thoughts and emotions a little more outwards. Let&#8217;s start sharing. Let&#8217;s stop being so shy with everyone else. Let&#8217;s start forging lasting partnerships. Imagine if you and your neighbours actually shared some stuff. Think that you would be closer? So do I. So next time you want to buy something consider going in with your neighbour, or anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>We buy shit when we get bored</strong></p>
<p>I find it interesting that when we have everything. We still want more shit. Imagine the following situation. You just bought the biggest purchase of your life. A brand new boat. You&#8217;ve started accumulating shit to put in the boat so you can impress your friends and have a great time on your new boat. This is great, it sounds awesome. There is nothing wrong with this situation. Except for this: what&#8217;s next???</p>
<p>I know what your thinking well you use it. Or do you? Is it big enough? Have you outgrown it? Is there a different type of boat that would be better? If only you had that other boat your life would be complete. I mean you can&#8217;t afford it know. But in ten years your life will be better when you can buy this boat.</p>
<p>From a personal perspective when I reflect on something that happened growing up I have no learnt a valuable lesson. My parents bought a boat in partnership with my Grandpa. Fucking brilliant. Did the partnership work out? Great I think, so what can I learn from this? What if my sister and I bought a boat together? With another neighbour? And another couple? Best case scenario we all get to use a cheaper boat. Worse case we all want to use it at the same time. In the latter we would just have more friends on the boat. Seems pretty awesome to me.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s get out there. Let&#8217;s start being social again. Let&#8217;s start risking our neck in friendships. Let&#8217;s see if people want some change. And let&#8217;s try not to consume new stuff just to make us happy. If we really need to, then let&#8217;s share it. Let&#8217;s start thinking about everything we buy. Do we really need one of these? Can we rent it?</p>

		<h2><a href="/2010/06/13/the-lifeboat-of-clairty.html">The lifeboat of clairty</a></h2>
		<p>My generation has been called the least empathetic generation yet. I was reading an article the other day on how entitled my generation feels, how arrogant and cocky we have become. This may be the case. It&#8217;s difficult to put a pulse on my generation. I don&#8217;t know why we have these feelings of entitlement. Perhaps we are starting to turn the corner of oppression? Maybe the younger generation is seeing that the world would be a better place if we all worked for ourselves not in a factory?</p>
<p>Personally I was offended when reading a comment about how my generation has no sticking power. We are too quick to jump ship and are not loyal. I&#8217;m not surprised, we have short attention spans. Have we been conditioned this way? Are we not just a product of our environment? Therefore what can be said for society?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not looking to rebuke the fact that my generation feels entitlement. There is no doubt in my mind that we do. I&#8217;m curious whether this is a harmful thing? Perhaps in the old world of cheap production and assembly line jobs, sticking power was good ,and entitlement was bad. What about a changing world? Do we want people to shut up? I&#8217;m not sure we want people who don&#8217;t give a shit give lip service to something. Perhaps this creates volatility in the workplace, but maybe good things happen when change is frequent? Not sure just thinking out loud.</p>
