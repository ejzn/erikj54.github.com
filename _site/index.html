		<h2><a href="/2010/08/11/rentingborrowing-vs-buying.html">Renting/Borrowing vs Buying</a></h2>
		<p>This post is inspired by a <a href="http://georgesaines.com/2010/08/10/be-happier-rent-everything/">posting</a> on Hacker news. Where George examines renting vs buying.</p>


	<p>This subject is interesting to me. Why do we all need to own everything? Is it more environmentally friendly for us to all have our own chainsaw at home? Or would it be more beneficial for a couple people we know to own one? It would seem that the latter would be a more efficient use of the earth&#8217;s resources.
So why is this not the case? My personal opinion on this is the following:</p>


	<p><strong>We are conditioned by companies to want our own everything</strong></p>


	<p>Our own house, car, Ipod, everything. No of course I&#8217;m not saying we need to share everything. Give it some thought though. Imagine yourself walking next store and borrowing the lawnmower from your neighbor. Imagine if he was the only one on the road who had one? Wow, wow, wow, I know what your thinking. Geez, Erik that sounds like a community. But you know a community is pretty much socialism, which is pretty much communism and that is just evil. Or is it? Should we start being less internal in our homes and our lives?</p>


	<p>I believe we need to start shifting our feelings, thoughts and emotions a little more outwards. Let&#8217;s start sharing. Let&#8217;s stop being so shy with everyone else. Let&#8217;s start forging lasting partnerships. Imagine if you and your neighbours actually shared some stuff. Think that you would be closer? So do I. So next time you want to buy something consider going in with your neighbour, or anyone else.</p>


	<p><strong>We buy shit when we get bored</strong></p>


	<p>I find it interesting that when we have everything. We still want more shit. Imagine the following situation. You just bought the biggest purchase of your life. A brand new boat. You&#8217;ve started accumulating shit to put in the boat so you can impress your friends and have a great time on your new boat. This is great, it sounds awesome. There is nothing wrong with this situation. Except for this: what&#8217;s next???</p>


	<p>I know what your thinking well you use it. Or do you? Is it big enough? Have you outgrown it? Is there a different type of boat that would be better? If only you had that other boat your life would be complete. I mean you can&#8217;t afford it know. But in ten years your life will be better when you can buy this boat.</p>


	<p>From a personal perspective when I reflect on something that happened growing up I have no learnt a valuable lesson. My parents bought a boat in partnership with my Grandpa. Fucking brilliant. Did the partnership work out? Great I think, so what can I learn from this? What if my sister and I bought a boat together? With another neighbour? And another couple? Best case scenario we all get to use a cheaper boat. Worse case we all want to use it at the same time. In the latter we would just have more friends on the boat. Seems pretty awesome to me.</p>


	<p>So let&#8217;s get out there. Let&#8217;s start being social again. Let&#8217;s start risking our neck in friendships. Let&#8217;s see if people want some change. And let&#8217;s try not to consume new stuff just to make us happy. If we really need to, then let&#8217;s share it. Let&#8217;s start thinking about everything we buy. Do we really need one of these? Can we rent it?</p>

		<p>My generation has been called the least empathetic generation yet. I was reading an article the other day on how entitled my generation feels, how arrogant and cocky we have become. This may be the case. It&#8217;s difficult to put a pulse on my generation. I don&#8217;t know why we have these feelings of entitlement. Perhaps we are starting to turn the corner of oppression? Maybe the younger generation is seeing that the world would be a better place if we all worked for ourselves not in a factory?</p>


	<p>Personally I was offended when reading a comment about how my generation has no sticking power. We are too quick to jump ship and are not loyal. I&#8217;m not surprised, we have short attention spans. Have we been conditioned this way? Are we not just a product of our environment? Therefore what can be said for society?</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m not looking to rebuke the fact that my generation feels entitlement. There is no doubt in my mind that we do. I&#8217;m curious whether this is a harmful thing? Perhaps in the old world of cheap production and assembly line jobs, sticking power was good ,and entitlement was bad. What about a changing world? Do we want people to shut up? I&#8217;m not sure we want people who don&#8217;t give a shit give lip service to something. Perhaps this creates volatility in the workplace, but maybe good things happen when change is frequent? Not sure just thinking out loud.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2010/05/27/clutter.html">Clutter</a></h2>
		<p>We are at an impasse. To be effective at marketing, politics, or just plain influence on people we must find a way to matter. How can we matter when our days are filled with junk everywhere? It seems as though everyone on Twitter is an expert at helping entrepreneurs. Everyone is an expert at getting things done, or shipping an awesome product. Then why are they pumping my Inbox or twitter feed full of crap?</p>


	<p>We know the story, your building the next twitter/ MySpace for single adult that live at home and make no money. Got it, check. Why don&#8217;t we stop building useless crap and invest our time in something that matters? I&#8217;ve fallen victim to this as well. We try anything to succeed. We try and copy what was, what is, in an attempt to get our small piece of the pie. Why does all this matter? The world is now full of shit. There are too many social networks, too many advertisement on websites, too many charities and too many causes.</p>


	<p>The facts are no one gives a shit. They don&#8217;t want to interrupt there day to listen to what you have to say. So why are you wasting your time pumping there lives full of crap. I say we need to start over about what we really care about. Let people who want on to your bandwagon to join in. If they don&#8217;t want in fuck em.</p>


	<p>If there are a million charities which one are you most likely to donate too? How about what advertisements you&#8217;ll listen too? Probably something your interested in. Not some random stuff. There is just too much out there, you&#8217;ve got your clutter filter on.</p>


	<p>Do you think Seth Godin interrupts peoples day to tell them shit? Does he try and sell you crap you don&#8217;t want? People come to him. Granted he did start with a little tech start-up called Squidoo. The point is, people want to make lenses on Squidoo, just like people are enjoying Facebook for the time being. But as a Facebook user you can&#8217;t connect with everyone. Just as users on twitter with a zillion friends can&#8217;t read all there shit. The world is too cluttered.</p>


	<p>So pick something you care about and focus on that. The people that want in will join you and as Seth says: lead that tribe. It could be surfing, swimming, but my god it sure as hell can&#8217;t be social networking. Get that shit out of here.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2010/05/24/the-bp-oil-spill.html">The BP oil spill</a></h2>
		<p>Will we finally wake up? We&#8217;ve been tricked for the past hundred years that we are to be loyal to corporations and to the people at the top. Those days must end. We must start to be loyal when loyalty is due. Does BP deserve anyone&#8217;s loyalty? I guess that remains yet to be seen based on their reaction to this disaster. What is certain is that we must hold our corporations to a higher level. They must be better citizens of this planet. Better members of our community. Business must change, we must force corporations to change.</p>


	<p>Companies attempt to create huge profit margins. We must make sure that they are held in check. When someone gets screwed in a business deal then we all lose. Business must become about small incremental gains. We cannot, and should no longer pro-port the ideas of screwing each other to get ahead. These ideas may be mixed and mangled but BP is getting a bit of karma back for their screwing in <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704804204575070294234095792.html">Argentina</a>. Karma is a bitch, the only problem is BP is not the only one who is now suffering.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2010/05/06/the-beauty-of-canada.html">The Beauty Of Canada</a></h2>
		<p>The beauty of Canada is in the people and the landscapes. I&#8217;m not just talking about the sheer size which is cool but the immense diversity across the nation. There are several different regions wether Manitoba&#8217;s wheat fields, Nova Scotia&#8217;s rocky coastline, Alberta and BC Rockies or Norther Ontario&#8217;s wilderness. Then of curse the people hippie BC&#8217;ers, French from Quebec or the Newfie fisherman.</p>


	<p>It makes you wonder what brought us together? Who and Why? Well I&#8217;m sure people all have their opinions about the British and our loyalty to the throne in the past. Regarless standing on the citadel hill in Halifax I&#8217;m glad it is here for me to enjoy and a country I can really be proud of.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m not sure why I used to be loyal or excited about being Canadien apart from the obvious reasons (Hockey etc) but I do know nw after meetin countless nice people why I love this Country. In Halifax some locals bought us a round of Keiths and made us feel very welcome. In Northern Ontario in Cochrane a young wItress got us a place to stay at her ex Father in law&#8217;s field. In Montreal staying with friends or having or broken window covered and properly cleanuped for free by a bunch of nice guys.</p>


	<p>I can now say that I love this country for a reason. I&#8217;m proud to be from here and I feel lucky to have this large country accesible to me. I&#8217;m sure there are countless other countries that have similar things to Canada with plenty of nice people I think this is why Im so excited to travel.</p>


	<p>For now I will bask in the beauty and niceness that is Canada.</p>


	<p>Go Nucks.</p>
