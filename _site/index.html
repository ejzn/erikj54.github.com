		<h2><a href="/2011/01/29/Real-thinking.html">Some real thinking</a></h2>
		<p>
<p>A new initiative called the <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/929093--coffee-party-of-canada-proposes-better-way-to-spend-coffee-break">Coffee Party of Canada</a> attempts to get people to spend their coffee breaks holding politicians more accountable. It&#8217;s a great concept, and to me really underlines how small strange ideas can question our perception. I love the ingenuity.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2011/01/26/Perspective.html">Remember When We Were Up In Arms About Blowjobs?</a></h2>
		<p>
<p>Remember the days we were all up in arms about Bil Clinton&#8217;s blowjobs? I&#8217;m willing to bet he was not the first president to cheat on his wife. You know what strikes me as interesting? In spite of the fact that it&#8217;s horrible what he did to his wife, it&#8217;s kind of funny. We weren&#8217;t talking about the world ending, babies getting killed in Afghanistan, prisoner torture. It kind of makes you wonder, gee he may have been a bad husband, but hey if all we had to worry about were blowjobs, I&#8217;ll take the evil I know.</p>
<p>The perspective is everything in the paragraph and that is something to consider. Your life doesn&#8217;t seem so bad once you compare it to others. Just as Bill Clinton seems like a darn good president after seeing the best Texas had to offer. I think it&#8217;s important to keep things in perspective. It&#8217;s easy to think things are bad, but hey the world is always ending just wait till tomorrow then we are really screwed.</p>
<p>Barack Obama just gave his &#8220;State of The Union&#8221; address last night. It was a great speech that highlights to me, why he IS such a great president, but we won&#8217;t have that put into perspective until he is dead and gone. As with all changes they hurt and people will oppose them. Barack is doing his life&#8217;s work, while at the same time improving America. While watching the speech it made me wonder: How did our grandparents feel emerging from the Great Depression? What hope or lack of hope did they have? A war with Germany, and horrible droughts, yet North America emerged stronger. Are we in such a peril condition now? One might argue we are in a pretty good spot. Perspective is everything when thinking about this.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2011/01/23/Getting-Connected.html">Getting Connected</a></h2>
		<p>
<p>I recently purchased a used Nexus One. While I love the idea of a smartphone, I believe I understand the impacts associated with such a device. Cell phones have become a prime example of our impatience as people of this planet. The tech industry is exploding and the landscape is changing. People are losing land lines in favour of cell phones. Cell phones are being replaced nearly every two years. For me I pushed my previous phone to four years. I bought a used phone for a couple reasons:</p>
<p>First and foremost I wanted to purchase something that need not be replaced. The resources have already been mined. Second, I wanted to contemplate the decision and not fall victim to the trap laid by companies that we must have only the best. For me the Nexus One is the perfect solution. It&#8217;s a great phone that runs a great OS, with lots of tools for my needs.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how we can solve such a situation where the tech industry and the environment go hand in hand. We should not have to stiffle innovation to protect the land. They should be one of the same.<p></p>

		<h2><a href="/2011/01/17/The-imposter-syndrome.html">The imposter syndrome</a></h2>
		<p>I had to add this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">link<a/> to my blog because it pretty much sums up how I feel. While things have been awesome in my life, it&#8217;s hard not to wonder whether it&#8217;s just the luck that I was born a white male in Western Canada? Just some thoughts.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2010/12/21/Switching-to-Jekyll.html">Switching from Wordpress to Jekyll</a></h2>
		<p>This post is about my migration from Wordpress and my old blogging system to Jekyll. If you want technical details check out the following: <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/blog-migrations">link</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why did I switch</strong></p>
<p>Why did I switch? I swtiched because my blog had no need for a database. It is in effect a bunch of text and very little photos. Worpress is a great peice of software and <br />
the plugins can really make someone happy with the product. I have no need for all the complexity. I simply wanted somewhere to write my ideas down with some control.</p>
<p><strong>I got my blog back</strong></p>
<p>As a person who understand a fair bit more then the average blogger. I wanted the control back. I got my blog back. I was able to get control of the site content again. I&#8217;m now using git for all the content and web pages which is a super bonus. I can run and test on my local<br />
machine using the built in Jekyll server and push to the master branch when I want to deploy live. It&#8217;s great!</p>
