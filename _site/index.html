		<h2><a href="/2011/02/25/Exception-Programming-in-Python.html">Exception Programming in Python</a></h2>
		<p>
<p>I thought I better throw up some of my ideas before I forget to do this. Have you ever thought about using exceptions in your normal program flow? Well apparently it&#8217;s not the <span class="caps">WORST</span> thing ever. As far as we can tell the languages that try and make us follow all there big time rules end up with larger problems in the end: Massive memory footprints, so many modules it&#8217;s reading an essay to find where some code is located, and the list goes on and on. So what about a simple exception? Consider this:<br />
<br />
You would like to insert a value into a list, or some other structure and if it&#8217;s already there, well you don&#8217;t want a duplicate, but if it&#8217;s not, you want it in there right?</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>In Python it&#8217;s really quite simple:<br />

</p>
<p>This allows is to handle the error if the key does not exist, then we just put it in. Simple right? I thought so too.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2011/02/15/Power-of-Sport.html">The Power of Sport</a></h2>
		<p>
<p>I have trained at a decently high level in several sports. While I have not yet been able to compete at the Olympic level, sport is my life. I live for the morning when I can run, bike, swim or get my heart rate going. I live for the competition that puts my problems at ease and allows me to focus and enter &#8220;The Zone&#8221;. The Olympics have come under scrutiny in the past couple years for being too commercial or only a competition of the elite. I think we need to revists these issues and really look at what the Olympics is all about.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The Olympics is about uniting. It&#8217;s not about sponsorship or corporations. These things are inherent in any event on the scale of the Olympics. Sport has a funny way of uniting countries and peoples from all different backgrounds and all different religions. In South Africa, Nelson Mandella was able to use sport to effectively unite the people under the Springboks. In New Orleans a broken and unhappy people found happiness in the New Orlean Saints &#8220;Who Dat?&#8221;. The Olympics are not perfect, but the idea is: Unite us under sport.</p>
</p>
<p> There is something magical that happens when you push your mind and your body in competition. You discover who you are.</p>

		<p>
<p>A new initiative called the <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/929093--coffee-party-of-canada-proposes-better-way-to-spend-coffee-break">Coffee Party of Canada</a> attempts to get people to spend their coffee breaks holding politicians more accountable. It&#8217;s a great concept, and to me really underlines how small strange ideas can question our perception. I love the ingenuity.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2011/01/26/Perspective.html">Remember When We Were Up In Arms About Blowjobs?</a></h2>
		<p>
<p>Remember the days we were all up in arms about Bil Clinton&#8217;s blowjobs? I&#8217;m willing to bet he was not the first president to cheat on his wife. You know what strikes me as interesting? In spite of the fact that it&#8217;s horrible what he did to his wife, it&#8217;s kind of funny. We weren&#8217;t talking about the world ending, babies getting killed in Afghanistan, prisoner torture. It kind of makes you wonder, gee he may have been a bad husband, but hey if all we had to worry about were blowjobs, I&#8217;ll take the evil I know.</p>
<p>The perspective is everything in the paragraph and that is something to consider. Your life doesn&#8217;t seem so bad once you compare it to others. Just as Bill Clinton seems like a darn good president after seeing the best Texas had to offer. I think it&#8217;s important to keep things in perspective. It&#8217;s easy to think things are bad, but hey the world is always ending just wait till tomorrow then we are really screwed.</p>
<p>Barack Obama just gave his &#8220;State of The Union&#8221; address last night. It was a great speech that highlights to me, why he IS such a great president, but we won&#8217;t have that put into perspective until he is dead and gone. As with all changes they hurt and people will oppose them. Barack is doing his life&#8217;s work, while at the same time improving America. While watching the speech it made me wonder: How did our grandparents feel emerging from the Great Depression? What hope or lack of hope did they have? A war with Germany, and horrible droughts, yet North America emerged stronger. Are we in such a peril condition now? One might argue we are in a pretty good spot. Perspective is everything when thinking about this.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2011/01/23/Getting-Connected.html">Getting Connected</a></h2>
		<p>
<p>I recently purchased a used Nexus One. While I love the idea of a smartphone, I believe I understand the impacts associated with such a device. Cell phones have become a prime example of our impatience as people of this planet. The tech industry is exploding and the landscape is changing. People are losing land lines in favour of cell phones. Cell phones are being replaced nearly every two years. For me I pushed my previous phone to four years. I bought a used phone for a couple reasons:</p>
<p>First and foremost I wanted to purchase something that need not be replaced. The resources have already been mined. Second, I wanted to contemplate the decision and not fall victim to the trap laid by companies that we must have only the best. For me the Nexus One is the perfect solution. It&#8217;s a great phone that runs a great OS, with lots of tools for my needs.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how we can solve such a situation where the tech industry and the environment go hand in hand. We should not have to stiffle innovation to protect the land. They should be one of the same.<p></p>
