		<p>I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of thinking about athletics and sports. To me it has been a pillar of my life when I have been happiest. It seems as though I&#8217;m a little lost at times when I don&#8217;t have a large &#8220;ultimate&#8221; goal or I feel as though I&#8217;m just going through the motions. This has prompted me to think a lot about life after university and what I will do to make myself feel fulfilled. My thoughts are as follows:</p>
<p>It seems as though work can be a great way to express yourself and gain a sense of self accomplishment. Although I&#8217;m cautioned to be overly dependant on this for of fulfillment since it leads to work-a-holic type behaviour. Since we live in a post industrialized service economy it only makes sense that we &#8220;work&#8221; or perform services for money (since we no longer barter for goods). With this thought in mind it would be great to really be passionate and have a sense of fulfillment at thw workplace or to say it in a nicer while performing your profession of choice.</p>
<p>My second idea on fulfillment is challenges. I&#8217;m not sure if everyone has seen the move <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Wild">Into The Wild</a> but I recommend it. The real great idea I took from this file was that of challenges and new experiences I think the quote goes something like this: &#8220;&#8230;..the core of man&#8217;s spirit comes from new experiences&#8230;.&#8221;. Now this quote really summarizes how we feel when we travel or do something amazing. So I&#8217;m setting forth the challenge to myself to continue to be challenged (sounds corny right).</p>
<p>So to wrap this up the plan is to keep it interesting, my whole life try new things. There is a large world out there where professional sports and sports glory which I once took as the only goal are just a tiny spec. Self fulfillment and personal challenges go hand in hand. one last though to add, wouldn&#8217;t it be great if we could be fulfilled and passionate about conservation or mother earth as well I think that would be the ultimate so my next post might have something to do with <a href="http://www.canadians.org/">Council of Canadians</a> because I love Canada.</p>
