		<p>I&#8217;ve been doing quite a bit of thinking about how selfish I am. Are you selfish? I hope so. Do you let your morals be swayed by others? When someone walks in the room with more self confidence are you a child or adult about it.</p>
<p>1. I am selfish. This is easy to admit because I row, sleep, eat and go to school in a developed nation with lots of &#8220;resources&#8221;. I take the breaks life gives me and I exploit them to move forward, do you? I hope so. I find that I need to be selfish, at this stage in my life. I think it is important to recognize this though. If you can admit it and use it. I&#8217;m not planning on being selfish for my whole life but as a young university student this is the perfect time for me to be.</p>
<p>2. Morals, how strong are yours? They should be stronger. I can assure you that business and this world need an influx of people with stronger morals. I do not mean no sex before marriage, that is not a moral. I&#8217;m talking deep down right or wrong won&#8217;t do that bloody thing no matter how much money anyone gives me morals. These are in dire need, do you have yours?</p>
<p>3. Character strength: I enjoy poking around <a href="http://ycombinator.com/">Paul Garaham&#8217;s</a> Y combinator site. I think one of the best things it taught me lately is this: Are you a child? If someone questions you do you get defensive? If there is a bigger dog in the room are you ready to fight back or are you ready to work and get things done?</p>
<p>What do all three of these things have in common? Well as I want to start my own company I feel it is important to look at these three things in considering what the personality of my company will be. How selfish will I be? What resources / things will I exploit without being conscious of other people? What morals will it have? How far will the company go to succeed? And finally what kind of character strength will be promoted when someone says that those ideas suck? Will I fight back? Look for suggestions or just sit there swallowing my tongue?</p>
<p>So on that note look for http://www.vHive.ca to be up and running soon&#8230;.</p>
