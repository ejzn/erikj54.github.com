	<p>I have never been fond of reading books&#8230;that was until about 4 months ago. I&#8217;ve spent the better part of the last 4 months transforming who I am and how I perceive the world. How did this happen? It was by reading books (with the help of a good friend). The ideas in the books I&#8217;ve read in the last 4 months are by no means groud breaking. So why am I so impressed? I was able to see that there were in fact other people like me who shared some of the same opinions in a world that sometimes feels a little small.</p>
<p>We have worked in places where we try to get through the day and live for the weekend for long enough. We have put up with mediocrity for long enough. I was told as many of you were that University would be the savior of our lives. It is not. The books I have read have let me see these facts. Books provide a concrete form of ideas in a way that you can pause and think about. Conversation can be too quick, but books allow you to dig deep personally and have conversations with your self.</p>
<p>If your looking to change your life I know of lots of books that have changed the way I look at the world. At first it can be daunting to let yourself go a bit and open yourself to new ideas. I think this is partially why it has been so groundbreaking for me. I&#8217;m young, I&#8217;m not &#8220;dug in&#8221; as they say. Some of the best books I have read in the past four months have taught me to be more human, be creative, to lose the fake, and to just be a nicer person.</p>
