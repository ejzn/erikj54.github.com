	<p>It did not become apparent to me until I read Seth&#8217;s post on March 5th. I&#8217;ve been safe. The background is this: I have been applying to jobs over the past couple weeks. I refuse to apply to positions that are &#8220;normal&#8221;. I don&#8217;t want to be a cog. I would rather work for myself and force myself into innovation then be enslaved by low expectations and a show up type mentality.</p>
<p>Now this attitude did not become apparent to myself until after I read Seth&#8217;s post on March 5th regarding his visits to campuses in the U.S. It&#8217;s true, I am scared of huge companies. I want to affect change. I have been applying for positions at smaller companies with little hope of getting hired. Why? Because the minute someone takes a risk on me I want to be there. I&#8217;m not upset that most of the time I get little in the way of responses or completely ignored. My e-mails border on informal and my cover letters are walking a line of arrogance. But here is the catch, it&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;m not going to go completely fake to get a position I will hate. I know lots of great people who develop software that I can consult for future opportunities. So why still apply? I&#8217;m looking for a chance to be a part of a great organization, a small start-up or affect some real change.</p>
<p>My friend Jason brought up a great point to me once. My cover letter, resume or responses are filters. Filters for companies that I don&#8217;t want to work for. If they decided my answers are too brash or my approach is too confident or not formal enough <span class="caps">GREAT</span>, I don&#8217;t want you. Keep denying me and once I find a good opportunity it must be a good one.</p>
