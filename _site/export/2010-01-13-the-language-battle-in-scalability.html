		<p><a href="http://37signals.com/">37 Signals</a> is a big promoter of the Ruby On Rails framework, and why shouldn&#8217;t they be. They have the founder as a partner in the company. I&#8217;ve always liked the idea of different languages and can&#8217;t say I have too many preferences.</p>
<p>In my conversations with other developers, and classmates, there are several characteristics that people seem to use in defining their language of choice:<br />
<ul><br />
<li> Industry use / and or preference in job postings,</li><br />
<li> Elegance or what I call the hidden secret that few really know,</li><br />
<li> Familiarity.</li></p>
</ul>
<p><strong>Industry Use</strong></p>
<p>Let me address these in order starting with the first. Industry use is a big motivation for a lot of students. Most students would love nothing more then having all the buzz words in their resume. I&#8217;m not saying this is a bad approach because in my experience at large companies they just want their ass covered. If you say Java the HR screen-er says Java. It&#8217;s not until you start work that they may test you on this. I would like to point out though, that better smaller companies want people able to think and adapt to the right tool for the job. You can not know <span class="caps">ALL</span> languages, you&#8217;d be better off understanding the benefits of several and the pitfalls of many to make an informed decision once it comes time to start a project. I would bet money that good companies want and understand that you cannot know everything but you can learn everything provided you have a bit of motivation and enthusiasm.</p>
<p><strong>Hidden Elegance</strong></p>
<p>the reason I use this term is that it&#8217;s hard to properly use a tool unless you fully understand it&#8217;s workings. A hammer is easy to figure out the  flat surface would seem like a good spot to strike a nail. the grip seems like an easy place to grasp it. And when you use it it seems like the right tool for the job. Programming languages can be different. There seem to be many languages that pro-port to be the next language of choice for all tasks. This is a dangerous claim. Now I fully realize that they added a nail remover to a hammer, but does that always replace a crow bar??? Sometimes you still need a crow bar. JavaScript is a specific client side language that has a confused message with a large <span class="caps">API</span> and different functions in many browsers. It has some features that make it dangerous and some that make it elegant. Java too is used on the web on the desktop and seemingly everywhere, does this make it best for all situations? The hidden elegance is this, the language goals are so clearly not defined that it makes it difficult to chose the right language for a task, unless you have experience with this language, and you have exposed the hidden meaning of the language of which makes the code easy and elegant.</p>
<p><strong>Familiarity</strong></p>
<p>Not much needs to be said here, we all know that familiar things are easier to get started and are quicker off the line. Sure the old &#8220;we&#8217;ve seen this before and know how to solve it&#8221; is a good argument. But solving something a dumb way twice makes it neither smart nor productive. Needless to say go out and try a new language and learn it&#8217;s good features.</p>
<p>In closing, your wondering why I brought up 37 signals and scalability, the reason is this. Twitter was built on Ruby on Rails, and they did a great job. Rails did a great job making Twitter successful. Would they like to have a more traditional approach since they have grown to millions and millions of users. Well frankly probably yes. But I say that scalability is a good problem to have. Would the developers of Twitter thought so outside the box had they used an old &#8220;trusted&#8221; Java? Probably not. I bet that they would have missed the market had a clustered program, and most developers would have quit.</p>
