		<p>As I continue reading in an attempt to learn more about when / what to do with a business on the web I&#8217;ve encountered some interesting facts:</p>
<p>1. Most software we write is never used, well since I am student this is often the case. The fact that most of it is used is not surprising since we try and do to much. We bite off a large chunk then never deliver what is promised. What if we promised less and delivered more if possible? I like this idea better and I&#8217; going to apply it personally. So resolve to release a simple, early production version that needs a lot of fixes and I am embarrassed with.</p>
<p>2. They don&#8217;t buy it. Well as I&#8217;ve been talking a lot with a close friend about some of <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth&#8217;s</a> books he has a really good general theme. We are marketers first and developers second. Sell the damn thing. He shows in &#8220;The Dip&#8221; that it will be tough but most people don&#8217;t get over the dip and this is why they fail. So resolve to market and <span class="caps">BELIEVE</span> in my product.</p>
<p>3. Release Early. I touched on this in point 1 but I firmly believe this and have experienced the negative end first hand. Release early, I was amazed at the results of incremental development. You don&#8217;t splat out a 10,000 page paper the first time? Well okay some people do but your not one of them. Re-work it. Hire a professional to do up a better logo or graphic once you have the cash. If your always improving it then as Seth says the longer someone waits to use it the better for you since they get a better version.</p>
<p>4. Get intimate. I&#8217;m talking about getting in with someone who knows the field, or the target audience and can help dispel some of your myths. If you were building wedding planning software would you like the biggest firm in your city to use it? Then give it to them. Let them use it, then tell them the free ride is over once you made it good enough for them to use it. Focus on the &#8220;good enough&#8221;, &lt;a href&#8217;http://37signals.com/&quot;&gt;37 signals</a> doesn&#8217;t build fancy features that no one will use why should you.</p>
