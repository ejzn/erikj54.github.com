<p>Seth Godin, do I need to say more? you know he&#8217;s a big deal when you type in his first name and he appears as the second result only to Wikipedia. What is Seth all about? Well honestly he doesn&#8217;t tell us anything ground breaking, unless there is something I&#8217;m missing. The idea is simple and it resides in all of us. Common sense, I watched some of the <a href="http://www.lemonademovie.com/">movies</a> he appeared to have helped out with and was not amazed but relatively surprised at how trivial but yet astonishing the ideas that were presented.</p>


	<p><strong>Creativity</strong></p>


	<p>Being in my final semester of school it is really interesting how everyone is excited for me to graduate. This is of course a good thing and I appreciate my family and friends support but please do not sit in awe of me. University was not hard, it was a lot like army camp. When I was 17 I spent the summer at boot-camp becoming a soldier. Universtiy resembles this in a lot of astonishing ways. At University in Engineering you are taught not to think. Well okay not to &#8220;not think&#8221; but to not be creative. This appears to be the nature of the beast in so far as they have the &#8220;APEGBC&#8221; Association Of Professional Engineers etc etc. The mandate of organizations is that all students are the same know the same things and are in effect rolling off of a machine line. Now apparently this organization oversees that bridges don&#8217;t collapse&#8230;.well fair enough I guess you do what you have to do. But please don&#8217;t tell me school is hard. The hardest part about school was sucking it up and doing all the shit I had no interest in.</p>


	<p>The shackles are almost off now. I no longer must do what other people tell me to do. Or learn what they see fit so I can be a slave to graduate. I know, this sounds harsh but think about it. Any free thinking individual should not be told what they must learn or how they must learn. Isn&#8217;t the market place supposed to be the great equalizer where no matter how smart or how well you follow rules society only pays you for the value you put forth? This has no bearing on what you &#8220;know&#8221; or what &#8220;degree&#8221; you have. If I built a great umbrella holder that fitted to wheelchairs and sold a billion would people care that I was a mechanical engineer? No, and I&#8217;m not.</p>


	<p><strong>Innovation</strong></p>


	<p>This follows similarly to the create. The idea here is that we are taught boundaries. You cannot do something that way because it is not done that way. Well you know what I don&#8217;t know any better. So I did it this way and you know what it changed the game. It&#8217;s always the same story <span class="caps">PHD</span> students and other people who change the game because either they saw the future like and made it like our good buddy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs">Jobs</a>, or they did not know any better. you know what they have in common though? The decided that they would change the way things are done. So what happens if you don&#8217;t?</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve read a couple of Seth&#8217;s books and he has one idea that he really pushes throughout them. The game <span class="caps">HAS</span> changed, if your in advertising, newspaper etc it will never be the same. We always want the 50&#8217;s back with high salaries on the factory line. <span class="caps">IT IS OVER</span>. Do you think newspapers will ever be the #1 form of journalism? No, never again I will guarantee it. Do you think advertising will now only take place at big companies? No, freelancers will change the game and they <span class="caps">HAVE</span>.</p>


	<p><strong>Quit</strong></p>


	<p><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/the_dip/"><img src="http://erikjohnson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/thedip.gif" alt="thedip" title="thedip" width="150" height="218" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-76" /></a></p>


	<p><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/the_dip/">The Dip</a> has some interesting concepts. I really love how simple it is. If you suck at something and can <span class="caps">NEVER</span> be #1 then quit. Now I&#8217;m not saying you can&#8217;t get better but honestly being #1 is the best. Why not strive to be the best? Why take on so many things? I have on argument, it&#8217;s good to diversify to try things and find out what you like don&#8217;t like and what you are good at. But once you find it quit the other stuff.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m not a quitter, I don&#8217;t quit things. I hate the feeling quitting gives me so I don&#8217;t do it. But here is how I really see myself using this advice from the book:</p>


	<p>&#8220;Decide before the race the conditions that will cause you to stop and drop out. You don&#8217;t want to
be out there saying, Well gee, my leg hurts, I&#8217;m a little dehydrated, I&#8217;m sleepy, I&#8217;m tired, and its cold
and windy. And talk yourself into quitting. If you are making a decision based on how you feel at
that moment, you will probably make the wrong decision.&#8221; &#8211; Dick Collins</p>


	<p>That is some great shit. I mean honestly don&#8217;t sabotage yourself. But think about it before, it could be your job, your relationship, school whatever. Just don&#8217;t quit for the short term benefit, quit for the long term.</p>
