<p>We&#8217;ve all heard the old adage that your code should be your comments. So why not have your work be your communication? <span class="caps">DHH</span> raised this as a simple background point in a talk at Stanford, for me this was the most profound point he made. How can we increase coordination on teams? How can we all get on the same page? It&#8217;s not complicated, it makes so much sense, if the whole team has ideas instead of drawing pictures write code. Instead of trying to explain it, do it.</p>


	<p>Why has this not occurred to me before. If I want someone to understand what I mean why not code it up. If it&#8217;s wrong let&#8217;s change it. So simple, but so effective. This is maybe why Rails or Django would work so well for software development. It doesn&#8217;t take you all week to set-up a first run or create some prototypes, your free you to create.</p>
