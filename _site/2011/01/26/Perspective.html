<p>Remember the days we were all up in arms about Bil Clinton&#8217;s blowjobs? I&#8217;m willing to bet he was not the first president to cheat on his wife. You know what strikes me as interesting? In spite of the fact that it&#8217;s horrible what he did to his wife, it&#8217;s kind of funny. We weren&#8217;t talking about the world ending, babies getting killed in Afghanistan, prisoner torture. It kind of makes you wonder, gee he may have been a bad husband, but hey if all we had to worry about were blowjobs, I&#8217;ll take the evil I know.</p>
<p>The perspective is everything in the paragraph and that is something to consider. Your life doesn&#8217;t seem so bad once you compare it to others. Just as Bill Clinton seems like a darn good president after seeing the best Texas had to offer. I think it&#8217;s important to keep things in perspective. It&#8217;s easy to think things are bad, but hey the world is always ending just wait till tomorrow then we are really screwed.</p>
<p>Barack Obama just gave his &#8220;State of The Union&#8221; address last night. It was a great speech that highlights to me, why he IS such a great president, but we won&#8217;t have that put into perspective until he is dead and gone. As with all changes they hurt and people will oppose them. Barack is doing his life&#8217;s work, while at the same time improving America. While watching the speech it made me wonder: How did our grandparents feel emerging from the Great Depression? What hope or lack of hope did they have? A war with Germany, and horrible droughts, yet North America emerged stronger. Are we in such a peril condition now? One might argue we are in a pretty good spot. Perspective is everything when thinking about this.</p>
