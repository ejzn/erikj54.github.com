<p>Well today was the Pitch-it competetion at <span class="caps">UVIC</span>. 120 seconds to explain your idea and concept to the judges for a chance at 300$. There were lots of great ideas and I&#8217;m not totally ashamed to say I was not a finalist. The feedback was good from the panel but they seemed unconvinced over the revenue potential. So since I didn&#8217;t have time to show them during the presentation I will rant here:</p>


	<p>First, a small software solution that manages volunteers has a large market potential. There are thousands of small volunteer driven events all across North America. I&#8217;m not saying were going to be be billionaires but it is not a stretch to imagine 100 subscriptions a month to our service. 100 subscriptions would translate into approx 20,000 dollars in revenue a month.</p>


	<p>I pick this number since I don&#8217;t need to sell 200 dollars to the volunteer organization. I need to sell it to the coordinator. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll find out what the market is willing to pay but in the end my &#8220;sales force&#8221; will be the coordinators who will love the system.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m hoping in the plan-it I can stress that following two main points:</p>


	<p>First, move the bottle neck of communication from the coordinator onto the users, by allowing user to user contact.</p>


	<p>Second allow users to pick your shifts and they are happy and not stuck with shifts there not interested in.</p>
