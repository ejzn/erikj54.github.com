<p>I had to do it. I have been thinking a lot about past and moving forward. So on that note I had to reminisce a little on last summer. It was my first summer rowing full time. Summer Club at <span class="caps">UVIC</span> is about 530am mornings every day during the week with a double row on Saturdays at 7 and 11. Now for summer club it&#8217;s not just any old rowing club it&#8217;s about <span class="caps">VOLUME</span> training. We rowed our hearts out. 21 kilometer steady state rows, 6&#215;2K etc.</p>


	<p>The rowing was awesome we took time trials every week to track progress all in <span class="caps">PAIRS</span>. Let me tell you that rowing in a pair is the best thing going for training. The stability and finesse you need to learn to make the boat go fast benefit you directly in the &#8220;8&#8221;.</p>


	<p>Looking back that was one of the best summers /  times of my life. I was fortunate enough to have two great coaches Paul Hawksworth and Barney Williams <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTJef4BLwSA&#38;feature=PlayList&#38;p=920DB7196266BCB6&#38;index=0&#38;playnext=1">Silver 2004</a> second only to Matthew Pinsent and James Cracknell.</p>


	<p>Barney recently gave us a quick talk about goals and achievements.  I realized pushing myself everyday to be better and to be my best made me really happy. Barney said it perfectly: &#8220;If you set a distinct goal then achieve it now what? (well I guess you could set another), but most likely you won&#8217;t get it. If you try to be your best everyday then take what comes at you in stroke.&#8221;</p>
