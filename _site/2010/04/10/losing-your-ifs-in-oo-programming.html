<p>Today I was faced with the task of determining how to render some abstract set of objects in a <span class="caps">GUI</span>. The task is not really relevant but it was a network topology. Now I could have easily done the following:</p>


	<p>if topologyType  1:</p>


	<p>do something</p>


	<p>else if topologyType  2:</p>


	<p>do something else</p>


	<p>Instead of doing this I did the following:</p>


	<p>1. Created an interface with a do somethingMethod.</p>


	<p>2. Created 2 classes that implement this interface.</p>


	<p>3. Put the code from the if statements into the doSomething() method.</p>


	<p>4. Called do something on the interface type.</p>


	<p>Ah how I hate switch statements, I think I&#8217;ve finally realized how we can avoid these statements for meaningless things. Yes I know the classes I created are small and now I have a couple more files&#8230;.but seriously it reads wayyyyy better.</p>
