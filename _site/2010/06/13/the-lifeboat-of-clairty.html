		<h2><a href=""></a></h2>
		<p>My generation has been called the least empathetic generation yet. I was reading an article the other day on how entitled my generation feels, how arrogant and cocky we have become. This may be the case. It&#8217;s difficult to put a pulse on my generation. I don&#8217;t know why we have these feelings of entitlement. Perhaps we are starting to turn the corner of oppression? Maybe the younger generation is seeing that the world would be a better place if we all worked for ourselves not in a factory?</p>
<p>Personally I was offended when reading a comment about how my generation has no sticking power. We are too quick to jump ship and are not loyal. I&#8217;m not surprised, we have short attention spans. Have we been conditioned this way? Are we not just a product of our environment? Therefore what can be said for society?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not looking to rebuke the fact that my generation feels entitlement. There is no doubt in my mind that we do. I&#8217;m curious whether this is a harmful thing? Perhaps in the old world of cheap production and assembly line jobs, sticking power was good ,and entitlement was bad. What about a changing world? Do we want people to shut up? I&#8217;m not sure we want people who don&#8217;t give a shit give lip service to something. Perhaps this creates volatility in the workplace, but maybe good things happen when change is frequent? Not sure just thinking out loud.</p>
