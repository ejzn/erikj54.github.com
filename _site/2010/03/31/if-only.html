		<h2><a href=""></a></h2>
		<p>As a kid I was a sporty person. I grew up playing hockey, soccer,   baseball you name it I was into it. I tried it all karate, music, all of  it.  I&#8217;m fascinated with my childhood and how happy I was.Â  It does  seem however that something was awry. I can&#8217;t seem but  feel that I was  searching in my childhood. And I&#8217;ve been searching now for a long time.</p>
<p>I remember as a young  12 year old hockey player sitting in that  stands wishing I could play  for the local hockey team the Peninsula  Panthers that drew a crowd of  500-1000 fans every Friday night. I used  to wish that if only I could  make that team my life would be happy. &#8220;If  only&#8221;. Two words that have  haunted me my whole life.</p>
<p>When I was 15/16 I used to watch the  Panther games with friends and  still think if only I could make that  team. If only.</p>
<p>I spent the summer of my 17th birthday playing  hockey ant Next Level  Hockey camp. We played 3-4 times a week in the  summer and got better. I  was then offered a spot to play on a rival team  of the Peninsula  Panthers. My if only had almost come true.</p>
<p>I  was 17 when we played our first game against the Peninsula  Panthers. I  had made it. I was doing what I had set out to do. It was  incredible. My  if only had come to be. So as the year wore on I got  called up the the  Nanaimo Clippers Jr.A team. I played some games and  my next if only  began. If only I could play for them. And I did.</p>
<p>Fast forward now 5  years and I&#8217;m graduating University from <span class="caps">UVIC</span>. In  first year I would  repeat the same sentence with clarity and  familiarity: &#8220;if only&#8221;. If  only this test, if only this one time. If  only I could get through it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m  now going to graduate I can and I can&#8217;t help but thinking it  might be  time to give up those two words that have haunted me for so  long. To the  average person they seem okay, it&#8217;s just you wanting to  get to the next  step. My problem is this: If we are only doing this,  what comes next? We  are never doing anything worth doing if were only  going for only.</p>
<p>So  here we go. I&#8217;m officially getting rid of it. If only is now  gone. I  will accept now all: Because, in-spite of, after the facts. I  will not  limit myself to specific if only&#8217;s. I will now strive further.  If I  don&#8217;t get somewhere I will not measure my happiness by a value of  if  only.</p>
<p>This is really about happiness. If we convince ourselves  that  happiness comes from if only&#8217;s we are wrong. If we bank on the if   only&#8217;s we are wrong. Do you think Joe Thorton is happy if only he could   make the <span class="caps">NHL</span>. Little good that would do him.</p>
<p>So it is gone. And  now my true journey begins with no more if only. I  will be better then if only. My happiness will be more then and if  only.</p>
