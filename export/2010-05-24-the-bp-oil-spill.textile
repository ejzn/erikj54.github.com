title: The BP oil spill
---

Will we finally wake up? We've been tricked for the past hundred years that we are to be loyal to corporations and to the people at the top. Those days must end. We must start to be loyal when loyalty is due. Does BP deserve anyone's loyalty? I guess that remains yet to be seen based on their reaction to this disaster. What is certain is that we must hold our corporations to a higher level. They must be better citizens of this planet. Better members of our community. Business must change, we must force corporations to change. 

Companies attempt to create huge profit margins. We must make sure that they are held in check. When someone gets screwed in a business deal then we all lose. Business must become about small incremental gains. We cannot, and should no longer pro-port the ideas of screwing each other to get ahead. These ideas may be mixed and mangled but BP is getting a bit of karma back for their screwing in <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704804204575070294234095792.html">Argentina</a>. Karma is a bitch, the only problem is BP is not the only one who is now suffering.
