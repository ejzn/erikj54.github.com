  I think that one of the great things about the web is that the server platform can be changed transparently without disrupting the user experience. Twitter is one of a select few applications which has grown to an enormous size, and if they have been able to use Rails up to this point, I'd say that the single database framework is a safe bet. Whatever scalability problems Twitter is having, they should be able to get around them.
  
  That said, I don't know anything about OpenCL, but I know that there is a sort of revolution going on in the database world. People are starting to gain experience with distributed databases like HBase and Google's App Engine datastore. If these technologies start to become easier to use, relational databases could be on the way out.

  I think people subconsciously segregate themselves into groups where they can be around similar people. The advantage of presenting yourself exactly as you are is that you will not end up somewhere where you feel out of place. This segregation process ensures that.
  
  Applying for jobs is part of that. Present yourself as you are, and the type of company that wants to hire you will likely be the type that you want to work at.

  I've always had to take an afternoon nap at times when I wasn't sleeping enough hours at night, but I don't really feel the need when I'm already getting a solid 8 hours.
  
  I think coffee is a horrible idea in general, at least as a daily habit. I've found that having some cold water can help when feeling a bit sleepy, though.

content: I'm using pyjamas (the Python to Javascript converter) for my project right now, and overall I'm happy with it. At the same time, these types of cross-platform abstractions are never completely air-tight, nor could they realistically be so. I find they can be a pain to use, but much less of a pain than it would be without them.

  Yeah that's what I've been thinking. It's interesting though since HTML and JavaScript have been kind of decried as not good enough for so long. Now that Web 2.0 has come along and shown us that we can do more then we think with HTML / JS they seen to be an emerging technology again. Not to mention Google's new OS which essentially just runs a web browser, the "desktop" in the traditional sense may be gone for ever? I'm excited to see what changes get in HTML 5 and how fast the web adopts them. ie XForms is a recommendation to be included in HTML 5 mark-up.
  
  But enough with that aside. I guess the abstraction layer has you lose some of the custom control in favour of cross-platform, easier coding.

content: To use more of 37signals' language, you avoid illusions of agreement by focusing on the real product rather than documents and diagrams. When there is a real product to look at, all the confusion from trying to spec things out just melts away and everyone suddenly has relevant things to say. It's also like the concreteness principle of Made to Stick.

  Yes...that's exactly it. When you focus on the real product the other things just melt away. Your no longer trying to dream things up and make some vision of abstract concepts. It does resemble the concreteness a lot. I would also add that it removes the dream of those documents, and replaces as you say with relevancy. People can get caught up in the excitement of designing a system with little real world value when they are allowed to write laundry lists of requirements and everyone just kind of goes along with it as okay sure add it to the list.
  
  And yeah I have been doing some research about the efficiency of the Django framework / RoR as a replacement for cringe "enterprise" systems currently. The arguments against scalability of the web 2.0 frameworks are slowly melting away. After reading some of the Django book last night I decided I'm a real fan. Then I came across that logo and thought I better add it.

  I was never a big reader myself. The first book I read that had a big impact on me was "The Pragmatic Programmer", and that was assigned as a school course book. A couple years later I picked up a few more on my own (Bob Martin's "Clean Code" for example) and now again in the past 6 months my reading has skyrocketed.
  
  I think once you read a handful of good books that really change you, you realize how much power there is on the shelves at Chapters. The floodgates just open and you become a voracious reader. There is only a small range of ideas and thoughts that we can derive on our own without mixing in the ideas of others, and the more you do it, the better your own understanding of the world becomes.
  
  By the way, I'm finished with your Tom Peters book. He makes a few references to the Dale Carnegie book that I gave you, and it's clear that Dale Carnegie was an influence on him. Have you started reading it yet?
