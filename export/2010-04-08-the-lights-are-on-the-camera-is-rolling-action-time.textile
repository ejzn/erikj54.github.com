Here goes.....today was the last day....and now action:

"The main idea is to be conscious of what we do ... While I felt this way for some time, it was only recently that I was  able to get past my own habits and such and to make a move, to do  something, which as far as I understand, is what it's all  about. Action."

Adapted quote from Matisyahu....it just seems relevant event taken a bit out of context. We must start to take action. Action in our future, our life, our habits. Consciousness is not a gifts but a curse, a curse that can be controlled only by action. Once conscious we are required to do "the only thing worth doing".....the only thing worth doing indeed.
