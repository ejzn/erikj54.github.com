title: Summer Club rowing
---

I had to do it. I have been thinking a lot about past and moving forward. So on that note I had to reminisce a little on last summer. It was my first summer rowing full time. Summer Club at UVIC is about 530am mornings every day during the week with a double row on Saturdays at 7 and 11. Now for summer club it's not just any old rowing club it's about VOLUME training. We rowed our hearts out. 21 kilometer steady state rows, 6 x 2K etc.

The rowing was awesome we took time trials every week to track progress all in PAIRS. Let me tell you that rowing in a pair is the best thing going for training. The stability and finesse you need to learn to make the boat go fast benefit you directly in the "8".

Looking back that was one of the best summers /  times of my life. I was fortunate enough to have two great coaches Paul Hawksworth and Barney Williams <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTJef4BLwSA&feature=PlayList&p=920DB7196266BCB6&index=0&playnext=1">Silver 2004</a> second only to Matthew Pinsent and James Cracknell. 

Barney recently gave us a quick talk about goals and achievements.  I realized pushing myself everyday to be better and to be my best made me really happy. Barney said it perfectly: "If you set a distinct goal then achieve it now what? (well I guess you could set another), but most likely you won't get it. If you try to be your best everyday then take what comes at you in stroke."
